  <h3>Introduction</h3>
	<p>
    This publication contains information to support FHIR tools working with openEHR content.
    Specifically, it contains a FHIR representation of the openEHR reference model.
    In general, this IG is a technical internal artifact to the tools; it's not anticipated
    that the implementers who use either openEHR or FHIR will need to look at this. (hopefully)
